In this exercise, we are going to work with **gene expression quantification** from **RNA-seq** experiment from [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70466) study.

- &#x1F4DD; **Activity**: Follow the link above to familiarize yourself with the type of samples in the data set.
    - What are the two cell lines from which this data set is composed of?
    - Which cell line in this experiment represents the normal cells?
    - Which cell line in this experiment represents the tumor cells?
    - How many samples are there from each cell line? 
    - Which sequencing platform was used for sequencing?
